/** 
 * 1. We will start this project by building an IFFE function ( Immediately Invoked Function Expression ). 
 * IFFE is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.
 * 
 * 2. As can be seen below, the IFFE Expression has a semi-colon ";" before it. This has been added, in case the file is minified at any point of time and the preceding code does not have a semicolon
